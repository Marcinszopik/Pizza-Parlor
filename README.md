## Description

This web application will gather input from the user (pizza toppings and pizza size specifications) to order pizzas. The application can handle multiple pizza orders and calculates total cost.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate understanding of constructors and prototypes to add methods to an object.

Objectives: Create a website for a pizza company where a user can order a pizza and see the final cost.

Allow the user to choose toppings and size for the pizza they'd like to order.

Create a pizza object constructor with properties for toppings and size.

Create a prototype method for the cost of a pizza depending on the selections chosen.

Code must meet standards from previous weeks.
